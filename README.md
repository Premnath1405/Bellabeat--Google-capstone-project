# Bellabeat--Google-capstone-project
INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the case study developed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone activities of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. This course promoted knowledge and skills development about the analysis processes (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act) that were useful in this case study. This study made it possible to put this knowledge into practice to answer key business questions from real scenarios, such as the high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, Bellabeat. To develop this project I chose to use tools such as Excel, SQL, RStudio and Tableau.
