# Bellabeat--Google-capstone-project
INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the case study developed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone activities of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. This course promoted knowledge and skills development about the analysis processes (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act) that were useful in this case study. This study made it possible to put this knowledge into practice to answer key business questions from real scenarios, such as the high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, Bellabeat. To develop this project I chose to use R Studio

A clear statement of the business task

The purpose of the business task is to analyze data from non-Bellabeat smart device users to gain insights that can be applied to Bellabeat smart devices, such as the smart bracelet, "Leaf", or the Bellabeat subscription. In addition, trends applicable to users and influencing marketing strategies are welcome.

A description of all data sources used

This dataset is located on Kaggle and is in the public domain - FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). They are presented in spreadsheets, with the data organized into 18 files and titled by category. The archives include information such as: Id numbers, date, daily activity, heart rate, calories, steps, and Intensities por horas, as well METs (metabolic equivalent of task) by minute, sleep day and information about weight. Data were obtained between April 12 to May 12, 2016. In addition, the survey was developed by Amazon Mechanical Turk, that is, a reputable company that contributes to the integrity of the data but needs to be confirmed.

PROCESS

I downloaded data from "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data" to my computer.

The data was all in the form of a .csv file, a total of 18 files. I opened some files in Excel and realized that they were very large. Therefore, it would be efficient to perform the cleaning and analysis by SQL or R Studio. I preferred to go with R sudio
